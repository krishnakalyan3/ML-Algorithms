# Pseudocode KMeans (Lloyd's algorithm)

## Initialize
    # Choose k (Number of Clusters); 3
    # Choose num iterations; 100
## Choose random indexes from the data based on k
## For loop number of iteartions:
    # Euclidean distance between the cluster centers values and the data points
    # Assign the data to the cluster with minimum euclidean distance
    # Calculate the new means to centroids
    # Assign the new means as the new cluster centers values
## Stop iteration if the clusters dont change
